# Form Properties [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This section of the SDK describes the properties you set on forms in the Application Object Tree (AOT).

To provide a uniform application interface, many properties have **Auto** values. You can create forms by using a drag-and-drop operation, and then manually setting several properties.

To specify the name of the form, you set the **Name** property in the **Properties** window for the form. All the other properties on the top-level node for the form are system properties and are read-only.

This section contains the following topics that describe the properties of the sub-elements of forms:
