# Page-level Navigation Overview [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Some pages in Enterprise Portal have navigation on the left side of the page. SharePoint refers to this section of the page as the QuickLaunch area. Most pages, such as Role Center, Area, and List pages, have this left-side navigation.

The page-level navigation provides links to related areas for the current page or module site. Two web parts can be used for the page-level navigation:

  - QuickLaunch

  - Left Navigation

Each of these web parts displays a Web Menu. The Web Menu contains Web Menu Items that specify what page to display or what action to perform.

Each module site defines a QuickLaunch, which is the set of menu items to display in the QuickLaunch area of each page in the module site. Pages in the site have the QuickLaunch web part added in their left column. This web part automatically displays the menu items defined in the submodule's QuickLaunch.
