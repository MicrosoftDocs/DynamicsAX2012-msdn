# Proxy Classes for .NET Interop to X++ [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A proxy class is a .NET Framework class that provides access to one X++ item type of Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can build proxies for the following X++ item types:

  - Classes – both application and system classes.

  - Tables – both application and system tables.

  - Enums – both base and system enums.


> [!WARNING]
> <P>You cannot build a proxy for an X++ interface. If you try, a proxy is generated for a .NET Framework class which at best approximates the interface. This improper translation into a class causes some common scenarios to fail, and it might create problems in future releases.</P>



You can generate the proxy C\# or Visual Basic source code by using the Application Explorer in Microsoft Visual Studio. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Adding an X++ Object to a Visual Studio Project](walkthrough-adding-an-x-object-to-a-visual-studio-project.md).

Proxies are usually a better alternative to [.NET Business Connector](net-business-connector-overview.md). .NET Business Connector requires your C\# code to use a late-bound programming model. Proxies require an early-bound programming model. The early-bound model enables the code editor to provide IntelliSense. The early-bound model also enables the compiler to catch misspellings and other errors before the code is run.
