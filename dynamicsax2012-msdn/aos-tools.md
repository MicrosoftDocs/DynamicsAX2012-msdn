# AOS Tools [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

There are a variety of tools that you can use in Microsoft Dynamics AX and Microsoft Windows to monitor the performance of your application and see how it interacts with the Application Object Server (AOS). This topic describes the tools that you can use to troubleshoot and repair problems related to the AOS.

## Windows Performance Monitor

Some parts of Microsoft Dynamics AX can be monitored with the **Performance Monitor** tool. It is integrated with Microsoft Windows Vista and with some earlier versions of Microsoft Windows.

After you open the **Performance Monitor** tool, select the AOS computer. You can then select the objects to monitor as the **Microsoft Dynamics Application Object Server** or **Process**.

## Windows Event Viewer

The AOS is Windows service and can be viewed in the Windows **Services** window. You can view AOS events and errors in the Windows **Event Viewer**. To open the **Event Viewer**, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Event Viewer**. In the **Application** node, you can view a list of AOS events.
