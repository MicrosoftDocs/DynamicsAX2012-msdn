# Reporting User Experience Guidelines 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

These topics provide guidelines for creating consistent layouts with different types of reports and charts in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.

The guidelines cover three different types of reports: outgoing documents, simple lists, and grouped lists layouts. They also detail what visual components should be enforced, such as font sizes, weights, colors, page size, titling, pagination, dates, and charting types and positions. There are also tips to help explain and distinguish the different reporting types and helpful suggestions about when a report would benefit from using a chart.

Collectively, these guidelines outline a strategy for displaying certain reporting components and types of data, and they provide best practices for creating reports that are always legible, easy to read, and cleanly organized.
