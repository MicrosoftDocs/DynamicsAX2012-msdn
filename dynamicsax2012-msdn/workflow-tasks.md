# Workflow Tasks [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Tasks provide application-specific behavior that you define in the AOT. Each task supports a single unit of work that is defined by one step. Although a task does not have a fixed outcome, you can add any number of custom outcomes to the task, such as **Completed** or **Skipped**. However, each task must have at least one outcome of type **Complete**.

This section describes the procedures that are used to create workflow tasks.
