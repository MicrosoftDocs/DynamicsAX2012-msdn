# Workflow Best Practices [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Best practice checks for workflow focus on the properties of workflow categories, types, approvals, and tasks. The checks verify that the properties are correctly configured. For information about how to set the options for best practice checks, see [Best practice parameters](best-practice-parameters.md). This topic includes general principles to follow when you develop workflows and a table of the best practice checks and how to fix the errors.

## General Principles

When creating a query for a workflow document, consider the following:

  - Most document data is available to set up conditions for workflow. In addition, the query identifies workflow placeholders used in messages in the configuration user interface for instructions and notifications. Make sure to use placeholder fields that the end-user can understand and not fields that contain internal data not typically visible to users.

  - By default, all data fields with the Visible property in the table set to Yes are exposed for workflow conditions. To simplify the set up for workflow conditions, you can remove unnecessary data fields that will not be used for workflow conditions or placeholders in the configuration UI. To remove data fields, set the Dynamic property on the **Fields** node of the data source to No. Expand the **Fields** node, right-click a field, and then click **Delete**. If the query is not saved, the **Delete** command is not available.

  - Set the Relations property of the query to Yes if the query system should use the relations that are defined for tables and extended data types. When set to Yes, the query is automatically updated if a relation is changed.

  - Optionally, set the Join Mode property of the query to Outer Join. Records in one data source are joined even if there are no matching values in the joined field from the second data source. Only fields from Inner Join or Outer Join are visible in the configuration user interface as conditions and placeholders.

  - In the **Properties** sheet, set the Table property to the table that contains the data for the workflow document. The root table in the query should be the same as the workflow data source property of the form.

When creating task and approval elements in the Application Object Tree (AOT), be sure to use unique and declarative label names for the element. When adding an approval to a workflow configuration, the label Approval would not be unique enough for the user to determine which approval is to be added.

Use the [WorkflowWorkItemActionManager Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg815458\(v=ax.60\)) to manage task or approval outcome action menu items for type Complete, Return, RequestChange, and Deny.
