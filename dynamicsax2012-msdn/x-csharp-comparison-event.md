# X++, C\# Comparison: Event 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

There are some differences in how X++ and C\# implement the event design pattern. For more information, see [Event Terminology and Keywords](event-terminology-and-keywords.md).

## Comparison of Events between X++ and C\#

There are differences in the way delegates are used for events in X++ versus C\#.

<p>All delegates are instance members of their class, not static members. No access modifier can be used on a delegate declaration, because all delegates are protected members. Therefore, the event can be raised only by code within the same class where the delegate is a member. However, the one exception to the private nature of a delegate is that code outside their class can operate on the delegates by using the += and -= operators.</p></td>

<p>Without the event keyword, you can have a delegate as a parameter type on a method, just as you can have a class as a parameter type. You can construct an instance of a delegate to pass in for the parameter value.</p></td>
<td><p>In X++, each class is a type, but no delegate is a type. You cannot construct an instance of a delegate. No delegate can be a parameter for a method. But you can create a class that has a delegate member, and you can pass instances of the class as parameter values.</p>

<td><p>In C#, the event keyword is used to declare a delegate type as a member of a class. The effect of the event keyword is to make the delegate protected, yet still accessible for the += and -= operators. You can subscribe event handler methods to an event by using the += operator.</p>
<p>A delegate can be useful without the event keyword, as a technique for passing a function pointer as a parameter into a method.</p></td>

## X++ and C\# Code Examples

This section contains an X++ code example for the event design pattern. It also contains a C\# code sample for the same design pattern.

### ![Gg881685.collapse\_all(en-us,AX.60).gif](images/Gg863931.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif "Gg881685.collapse_all(en-us,AX.60).gif")X++ Example

The important things to notice in the X++ example are the following:

  - The XppClass has a delegate member that is named myDelegate.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The AOT contains a node for the delegate. The node is located at <STRONG>AOT</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Classes</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>XppClass</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>myDelegate</STRONG>. Several event handler nodes can be located under the <STRONG>myDelegate</STRONG> node. Event handlers that are represented by nodes in the AOT cannot be removed by the -= operator during run time.</P>



  - The {} braces at the end of the delegate declaration are required, but they cannot have any code in them.

  - The XppClass has two methods whose parameter signatures are compatible with the delegate. One method is static.

  - The two compatible methods are added to the delegate with the += operator and the eventHandler keyword. These statements do not call the event handler methods, the statements only add the methods to the delegate.

  - The event is raised by one call to the delegate.

  - The parameter value that passed in to the delegate is received by each event handler method.

  - The short X++ job at the top of the example starts the test.

<!-- end list -->

```X++
    // X++
    // Simple job to start the delegate event test.
    static void DelegateEventTestJob()
    {
        XppClass::runTheTest("The information from the X++ job.");
    }
    
    
    // The X++ class that contains the delegate and the event handlers.
    class XppClass
    {
        delegate void myDelegate(str _information)
        {
        }
    
        public void myEventSubscriberMethod2(str _information)
        {
            info("X++, hello from instance event handler 2: " + _information);
        }
    
        static public void myEventSubscriberMethod3(str _information)
        {
            info("X++, hello from static event handler 3: " + _information);
        }
    
        static public void runTheTest(str _stringFromJob)
        {
            XppClass myXppClass = new XppClass();
    
            // Subscribe two event handler methods to the delegate.
            myXppClass.myDelegate += eventHandler
                    (myXppClass.myEventSubscriberMethod2);
            myXppClass.myDelegate += eventHandler
                    (XppClass::myEventSubscriberMethod3);
    
            // Raise the event by calling the delegate one time,
            // which calls all the subscribed event handler methods.
            myXppClass.myDelegate(_stringFromJob);
        }
    }
```

The output from the previous X++ job is as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>X++, hello from static event handler 3: The information from the X++ job.</p>
<p>X++, hello from instance event handler 2: The information from the X++ job.</p></td>
</tr>

This section contains a C\# code sample for the event design pattern of the previous X++ sample.

``` csharp
// C#
using System;

// Define the delegate type named MyDelegate.
public delegate void MyDelegate(string _information);

public class CsClass
{
    protected event MyDelegate MyEvent;

    static public void Main()
    {
        CsClass myCsClass = new CsClass();

        // Subscribe two event handler methods to the delegate.
        myCsClass.MyEvent += new MyDelegate
                (myCsClass.MyEventSubscriberMethod2);
        myCsClass.MyEvent += new MyDelegate
                (CsClass.MyEventSubscriberMethod3);

        // Raise the event by calling the event one time, which
        // then calls all the subscribed event handler methods.
        myCsClass.MyEvent("The information from the C# Main.");
    }

    public void MyEventSubscriberMethod2(string _information)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("C#, hello from instance event handler 2: " + _information);
    }

    static public void MyEventSubscriberMethod3(string _information)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("C#, hello from static event handler 3: " + _information);
    }
}
```

The output from the previous C\# sample is as follows:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>&gt;&gt; CsClass.exe</p>
<p>C#, hello from instance event handler 2: The information from the C# Main.</p>
<p>C#, hello from static event handler 3: The information from the C# Main.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Events and the AOT

Microsoft Dynamics AX has other event systems that apply only to items in the AOT. For more information, see [Event Handler Nodes in the AOT](event-handler-nodes-in-the-aot.md).
