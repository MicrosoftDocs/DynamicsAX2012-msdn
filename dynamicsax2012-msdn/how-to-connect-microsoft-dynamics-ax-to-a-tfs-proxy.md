# How to: Connect Microsoft Dynamics AX to a TFS Proxy [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can configure Team Foundation (TFS) version control to use a proxy server, which caches copies of version control files in the location of a distributed team. Using a proxy server can significantly reduce bandwidth requirements for remote developers.

## Accessing a TFS Proxy from a Microsoft Dynamics AX Client

You can access a TFS proxy from a Microsoft Dynamics AX client by updating the registry through Visual Studio or by setting an environment variable.

### To update the registry through Visual Studio

1.  Follow the procedure at [Configure Team Foundation Version Control to use Proxy Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=223434).

2.  Connect Microsoft Dynamics AX by using the same parameters you would for a physical server. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Local Version Control Parameters (Developer)](how-to-set-up-local-version-control-parameters-developer.md).

### To set an environment variable

1.  Open the System Properties window. For example, in Windows Server 2008, click **Control Panel** \> **System and Security** \> **System** \> **Advanced system settings**.

2.  Click **Environment Variables**.

3.  Click **New…** to create a new system variable.

4.  In **Variable name**, type TFSPROXY.

5.  In **Variable value**, type the URL of the proxy.

6.  Connect Microsoft Dynamics AX by using the same parameters you would for a physical server. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Local Version Control Parameters (Developer)](how-to-set-up-local-version-control-parameters-developer.md).
