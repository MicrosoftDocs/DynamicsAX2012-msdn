# Dialog Forms [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A dialog is a form you use to explicitly commit or cancel an action. Typically, you open a dialog while you work with one or more records in another form. You use the dialog to complete an action that is associated with the originating form. In Microsoft Dynamics AX there are two types of dialogs:

  - A dialog form is a small form you use to complete a defined task or process. The form enables you to enter information and then initiate or cancel the task.

  - A drop dialog form is a small form you open from a drop dialog button control. You use the form to enter information and then initiate the task or process.
