# X++ Coding Standards [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic provides general coding principles for Microsoft Dynamics AX.

  - Declare variables as locally as possible.

  - Check the error conditions in the beginning; return/abort as early as possible.

  - Have only one successful return point in the code (typically, the last statement), with the exception of switch cases, or when checking for start conditions.

  - Keep the building blocks (methods) small and clear. A method should do a single, well-defined job. It should therefore be easy to name a method.

  - Put braces around every block of statements, even if there is only one statement in the block.

  - Put comments in your code, telling others what the code is supposed to do, and what the parameters are used for.

  - Do not assign values to, or manipulate, actual parameters that are "supplied" by value. You should always be able to trust that the value of such a parameter is the one initially supplied. Treat such parameters as constants.

  - Clean up your code; delete unused variables, methods and classes.

  - Never let the user experience a runtime error. Take appropriate actions to either manage the situation programmatically or throw an error informing the user in the **Infolog** about the problem and what actions can be taken to fix the problem.

  - Never make assignments to the "this" variable.

  - Avoid dead code. (See [Dead Code Examples](dead-code-examples.md).)

  - Reuse code. Avoid using the same lines of code in numerous places. Consider moving them to a method instead.

  - Never use infolog.add directly. Use the indirection methods: error, warning, info and checkFailed.

  - Design your application to avoid [deadlocks](deadlocks.md).
