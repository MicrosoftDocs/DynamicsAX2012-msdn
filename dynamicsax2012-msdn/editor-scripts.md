# Editor Scripts [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Editor scripts help you to perform frequent tasks more quickly in the X++ code editor. For example, there are scripts to create templates for certain types of code constructs and methods, to convert lines of code into comments.

To use a script, click the Script button in the X++ code editor. You can also access the script menu by right-clicking in the X++ code editor, and then pointing to **Scripts**.

For example, to create an if … else statement:

  - Click the **Scripts** button, and then click **template** \> **flow** \> **ifElse**.

This creates the following block of code:

    if()
    {
    
    }
    else
    {
    
    }

To learn how to create an editor script, see [How to: Add a Script to the Code Editor](how-to-add-a-script-to-the-code-editor.md).
