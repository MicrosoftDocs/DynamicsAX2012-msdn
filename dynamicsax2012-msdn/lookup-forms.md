_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A lookup is a form that opens when you click the lookup button associated with a control. Typically, a lookup form presents a list of records that you use to select the data value for the control. To enable you to identify the value that you want to use, the lookup form gives you access to one or more data fields that are typically found on other forms.
