# Working with MorphX Development Projects [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can bundle code elements into a project in MorphX. This topic describes some of the activities you can perform with projects.

## Drag-and-Drop

If you drag a project from the Private node to the Shared node, the project is moved.

If you drag a project from the Shared node to the Private node, a copy is created. This is because others might want to use the shared project.

## Delete or Remove

When you delete an object in a project, the object is also deleted in the Application Object Tree (AOT).

Use **Remove** if you only want to remove the object from the project.

## Naming

Private and shared projects may have identical names.

## Changing the Order of Projects and Project Items

The projects listed in the Private and Shared project nodes, and items within projects, can be moved up and down by pressing the ALT + UP ARROW or ALT + DOWN ARROW keys.
