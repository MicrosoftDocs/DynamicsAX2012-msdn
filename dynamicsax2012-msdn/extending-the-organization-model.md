# Extending the Organization Model [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An organization is a group of people who work together to carry out a business process or to achieve a goal. Organization hierarchies represent the relationships between the organizations that make up a business. In Microsoft Dynamics AX, the organization model enables you to define the following types of internal organizations:

  - Legal entities

  - Operating units

  - Teams

For more information about the organization model, see [Organizations and organizational hierarchies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh209258\(v=ax.60\)).

You can extend the organization model to support customizations for independent software vendors or partners. You can extend the organization model by adding elements to particular base enumerations, and by extending particular classes.

## In This Section

The topics in this section describe how to extend the organization model. The extension is accomplished by creating a custom operating unit and creating a new purpose.
