You can set the title of a page after you create the page in Enterprise Portal and import it into the Application Object Tree (AOT).

## Setting a Page Title

### To set a page title

1.  In the AOT, expand the **Web** node, and then expand the **Web Files** node.

2.  Expand the **Page Definitions** node and locate the page for which you want to set the title.

3.  Display the properties for the page definition.

4.  Set the **PageTitle** property to the value to display on the page.
