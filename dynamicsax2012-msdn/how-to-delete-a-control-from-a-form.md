_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This topic describes how to remove a control from a form.

## To delete a control

1.  In the AOT, find and expand the form you want to modify.

2.  Expand **Designs**, expand **Design**, and then locate the control you want to remove.

3.  Right-click the control and then click **Delete** from the menu. If you are asked to confirm removing the control, click **OK**.
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > <P>If the control is part of a field group and you have used that group in the form design, you cannot delete it (it will reappear). It can only be removed by deleting it on the table or by moving it out of the field group on the table.</P>



4.  Right-click the form and then click **Save**.
