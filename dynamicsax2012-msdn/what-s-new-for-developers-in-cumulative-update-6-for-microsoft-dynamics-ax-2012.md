<td><p><strong>What is new or changed?</strong></p>
<p>In previous releases, the only mechanism for exposing Microsoft Dynamics AX services was by using the Application Integration Framework (AIF). This enabled applications to communicate with Microsoft Dynamics AX by publishing services to an enterprise network. With cumulative update 6 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, you can publish services to the Windows Azure Service Bus.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>The Windows Azure Service Bus adapter enables integration between Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 and cloud computing platforms. You can develop mobile, cloud-based, and enterprise applications that communicate securely with Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 over the Internet or through external networks by using the Windows Azure Service Bus adapter. The Service Bus acts as a message relay by enabling messages from the Internet to reach Microsoft Dynamics AX service endpoints on a private enterprise network and enabling message responses from the private network to reach the intended client over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find more information?</strong></p>
<p>The blog post <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=306178&amp;clcid=0x409">Microsoft Dynamics AX Services and Windows Azure Service Bus</a> describes how to configure Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 to publish services by using the Service Bus adapter.</p></td>
