## Modifying a Web Part

2.  In the ribbon, display the **Page** tab.

3.  Click the **Edit Page** command.

4.  In the menu for the web part, click **Edit Web Part**. The properties and settings for the web part will be displayed.

5.  Make changes to the settings. The settings for each Microsoft Dynamics AX web part type can be found in [Web Part Types](web-part-types.md), which contains a description of each web part type.

6.  Click **Apply** to have the changes applied to the web part.

7.  Click **OK** to save the changes and close the list of properties.

8.  Click **Stop Editing** in the **Page** tab to save the changes made to the page.

9.  If you will be distributing the web part modifications to other Enterprise Portal installations, import the updated page into the AOT. For more information, see [How to: Import Pages into the AOT](how-to-import-pages-into-the-aot.md).
