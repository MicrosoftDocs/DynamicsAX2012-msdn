# Compare Tool [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can compare application objects to find differences by using the **Compare** tool. After you identify the differences, you can insert, delete, or move the differences between the compared application object. This topic describes how to interpret the results of the comparison.

The **Compare** tool enables you to compare:

  - Two different application objects.

  - The same application object in two different layers.

  - Two versions of the same application object, if you are using version control.

  - Two versions of the same application object and the original version of the application object.

  - Two SSRS report designs, in cumulative update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2.

## Interpreting Compare Tool Results

After you run a comparison, the differences between the application objects are displayed in the **Comparison** form.

The following table describes the symbols and colors that are used to show differences between objects.
