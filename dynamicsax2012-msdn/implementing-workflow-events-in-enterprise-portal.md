# Implementing Workflow Events in Enterprise Portal [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The AxWorkflowActionBar provides several events that can be used if you want to perform additional actions as a document is processed through a workflow for Enterprise Portal. These events are optional. They do not have to be used for a standard workflow implementation in Enterprise Portal. The following table lists the events that are available:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />

<thead>
<tr class="header">

<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>EvaluatingCanSubmitToWorkflow</p></td>
<td><p>Occurs when the control attempts to determine whether the current record can be submitted to workflow.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>WorkflowConfigurationActive</p></td>
<td><p>Occurs after the control has loaded a configuration for the current record.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
