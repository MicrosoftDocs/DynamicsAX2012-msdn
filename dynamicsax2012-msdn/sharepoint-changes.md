# SharePoint Changes [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Enterprise Portal for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 uses capabilities of SharePoint to control the appearance of pages displayed to the user. The following sections discuss changes in how to control the appearance of content in Enterprise Portal.

## SharePoint Themes

SharePoint themes are the primary way to control the appearance of pages in Enterprise Portal. SharePoint themes changed significantly in SharePoint 2010. If you had created your own custom theme for Enterprise Portal in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, you will have to re-create the theme using the new technique for the newer versions of SharePoint. See [How to: Create New SharePoint Themes](how-to-create-new-sharepoint-themes.md) for more information.

## Cascading Style Sheets

The cascading style sheets for Enterprise Portal have been updated to support SharePoint themes. If you had modified the cascading style sheets for Enterprise Portal in an earlier version of Microsoft Dynamics AX, you will have to determine whether your changes are still required. See [How to: Modify Enterprise Portal Style Sheets](how-to-modify-enterprise-portal-style-sheets.md) for more information.
