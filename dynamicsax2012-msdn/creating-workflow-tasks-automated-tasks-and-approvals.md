# Creating Workflow Tasks, Automated Tasks, and Approvals 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

After you create a workflow type, you continue the process for creating a Microsoft Dynamics AX workflow by adding tasks, automated tasks, and approvals to the workflow type. A task is a workflow element with a single step defined in the Application Object Tree (AOT) that is used to implement task-based processes. An automated task is a workflow element used to invoke X++ code within the application without requiring user intervention. An approval is a specialized task that can have multiple steps defined in the AOT that is used to implement approval processes.

You create tasks, automated tasks, and approvals in separate AOT nodes and then, you can add them to the workflow type **Supported Elements** node. The same tasks and approvals can also be added to different workflow types.

This section describes the procedures that are used to create tasks, automated tasks, and approvals.
