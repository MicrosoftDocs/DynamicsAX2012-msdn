# Best practice parameters [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Best practice checks help to make sure that the best practice guidelines are followed. Use the **Best practice parameters** form to select which best practice checks to verify.

Select from the **Warning level:** drop-down to specify the kinds of messages produced. The warning levels are as follows:

  - **Errors only** - Messages only about best practice errors.

  - **Errors and warnings** - Messages only about best practice errors and warnings.

  - **All** - Messages about violations to all best practices checks.

Select from the **Layer setting:** drop-down to specify the layers that will be checked for best practice violations. The layer settings are as follows:

  - **Check all nodes** – All layers will be checked for best practice violations.

  - **Skip nodes from lower layers** – Only the nodes defined in the current layer and above will be checked for best practice violations.

Use the check box to select or clear individual checks.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Disabling a check suppresses the messages about violations to the check, not the check itself.</P>



The following table provides information on the best practice checks.

<td><p><strong>Use of labels for developer documentation</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether labels are used for developer documentation.</p>
<p>The <strong>DeveloperDocumentation</strong> property is used to describe the purpose of an element so that application developers are able to understand what the element is used for. The <strong>DeveloperDocumentation</strong> property appears in the <strong>Properties</strong> window for tables, views, and maps. The description provided for the <strong>DeveloperDocumentation</strong> property is typically no more than five sentences, and is written as a single paragraph.</p>
<p>This check examines the value entered for the <strong>DeveloperDocumentation</strong> property to ensure that labels are used. If a string rather than a label is used, an error displays indicating that the property must contain a label ID. If nothing is entered for the <strong>DeveloperDocumentation</strong> property, no warnings or errors display.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Fields belong to a field group</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether fields belong to a field group.</p>
<p>Any field that appears in the user interface must belong to a field group. This menas that field groups can always be used when you design a form.</p>
<p>A field group must be defined when several fields logically belong together and are shown together on forms and reports.</p>
<p>Field groups must be named by using a label on the <strong>Name</strong> property.</p>
<p>The following is a list of standardized group names.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identification</p></li>
<li><p>Description</p></li>
<li><p>Administration</p></li>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Financial dimensions</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether fields intending to hold foreign keys to a LedgerDimension (DimensionAttributeValueCombination.RecId) are properly defined in the table.</p>
<p>Fields must adhere to the following standards:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The field name must contain LedgerDimension. For example, OffsetLedgerDimension, or PostedLedgerDimension.</p></li>
<li><p>The field must extend an EDT that extends LedgerDimensionBase. For example, LedgerDimensionAccount, or LedgerDimensionDefaultAccount.</p></li>
<li><p>The field must not directly extend LedgerDimensionBase.</p></li>
<li><p>The field must have a proper Primary Key Foreign Key relationship set up to the DimensionAttributeValueCombination table RecId field.</p></li>
</ol></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Number of fields in field groups</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the number of fields in a field group.</p>
<p>A field group must be defined when several fields logically belong together and are shown together on forms and reports.</p>
<p>Field groups must be named by using a label on the <strong>Name</strong> property.</p>
<p>The AutoReport field group is defined on every table.</p>
<p><strong>AutoReport</strong></p>
<p>At least two fields must be included in the AutoReport field group on each table. These are the fields that the user expects to print when <strong>Print</strong> is clicked from the <strong>File</strong> menu. Often the fields specified for the <strong>TitleField1</strong> and <strong>TitleField2</strong> properties are candidates for the <strong>AutoReport</strong> field group.</p>
<p><strong>Dimension</strong></p>
<p>The dimension field must be the only field in the <strong>Dimension</strong> field group.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Currency code fields</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the use of the <strong>CurrencyCode</strong> related properties.</p>
<p>The <strong>CurrencyCode</strong> property must be set on all fields by using an extended data type derived from the Money system type, if the <strong>AnalysisVisibility</strong> property is set to <strong>High</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, or <strong>Low</strong>. It should not be set on any other fields. You must set <strong>CurrencyCode</strong> to <strong>SecondaryCurrency</strong> if the field uses an extended data type derived from AmountMSTSecondary; otherwise, set it to <strong>CurrencyCodeField</strong>.</p>
<p>If the <strong>CurrencyCode</strong> property is set to <strong>CurrencyCodeField</strong>, you must also set the <strong>CurrencyCodeTable</strong> property to the table that contains that field, or to a table for which a relationship exists from the table that contains this field, and in which a unique index exists for the fields on the target end of the relationship. If <strong>CurrencyCode</strong> is set to <strong>CurrencyCodeField</strong>, you must also set the <strong>CurrencyCodeField</strong> property to a field that uses an extended data type derived from the <strong>CurrencyCode</strong> property.</p>

> [!note]  
> <P>Do not use master currency amounts to set the <strong>CurrencyCode</strong> properties, because master currency amounts are always in the master currency for the associated company.</P>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Use of labels for entity relationship role</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether labels are used when describing the role of a table relation.</p>
<p>The <strong>EntityRelationshipRole</strong> property is used to clarify the semantics of a relationship defined on a table. A role name should be either a noun or a noun phrase. The role name should indicate the role of the associated table in relation to the associating object, or it should be a short phrase that starts with a present-tense verb that indicates the role that the table plays in the relationship. Role names are not required when the relationship is unambiguous.</p>
<p>This check examines the value entered for the <strong>EntityRelationshipRole</strong> property to make sure that labels are used. If a string instead of a label is used, an error displays indicating that the property must contain a label ID. If nothing is entered for the <strong>EntityRelationshipRole</strong> property, no warnings or errors display.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check that abstract classes are marked abstract.</p>
<p>A class must be marked as abstract if it extends an abstract class and does not implement all the abstract methods.</p>
<p>This can cause runtime errors when the abstract method is called.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>RunBase implementation</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check that classes are implemented according to the guidelines in the RunBase framework.</p>
<p>This check examines whether the description method is implemented.</p>
<p>RunBase framework implementations must have a static description method.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Missing member function</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the class for missing member functions.</p>
<p>Check that the class is not empty meaning no member variables and no methods.</p>
<p>The possible inheritance and declaration of variables are checked to determine if a member should be present.</p>
<p>At least one member function that does not calculate the ClassDeclaration must always be present in a class.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Constructors</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the implementation of class constructors.</p>
<p>This check validates that each class contains a static construct method.</p></td>

<td><p>Select or clear this check box to select or clear all best practice checks under the <strong>Methods</strong> node.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Empty methods</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check for methods with no code.</p>
<p>By checking for empty methods, you can detect whether any member functions have been created and left in the system without any code.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Date features</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the use of date features.</p>
<p>By checking the overall use of date features, you can check various problems related to date functionality.</p>
<p>It is typically not necessary to format a date to a string. Instead, use date fields, variables, and date controls directly on forms and reports.</p>
<p>Never permanently store a date in anything other than a date field.</p>
<p>If you must format a date to a string, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For user interface situations - use strFmt, or date2str with -1, in all the formatting parameters, to use the formatting the user has specified in Regional Settings.</p></li>
<li><p>For other specific system related situations, such as communication with external systems - use date2str, with the relevant parameters dictated by the situation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If Regional Settings dictates the format, be aware that the format can change from user to user, and that it might not be a suitable format for external communication.</p>
<p>When you use date2str, always make sure that the resultant string can be held in the receiving place. For example, ensure that the receiving variables are long enough.</p>
<p>Str2Date</p>
<p>Using str2date indicates that dates are being used that have previously had a string format.</p>
<p>Today</p>
<p>The system date provided by the today function should be used only where the actual machine date is needed.</p>
<p>Most application logic should use the system function systemDateGet, which holds the logic date of the system.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Access modifier</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether the access modifier of a method can be set to private, protected, or public based on how it is called.</p>
<p>This check examines how the access modifier of a method can be set to private, protected, or public, based on where it is called from.</p>
<p>A tip will be displayed if the access modifier of the method has not been set, and:</p>
<p>the method can be set to private instead of public.</p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p>the method can be explicitly specified as public.</p>
<p>If the programmer has explicitly specified any of the possible access modfiers, the check is skipped.</p>
<p>The compiler will check whether combinations are possible.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Print &amp; pause</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the source code for the use of print and pause statements.</p>
<p>Avoid the use of print and pause statements for any purpose other than testing.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Use of variables</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check how variables are used.</p>
<p>This check examines how variable are declared and used. Unused parameters and variables will be exposed. Additional checks for good programming styles, such as some of the naming rules of variables, are also covered by this check.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Future reserved words</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether any names conflict with future reserved words.</p>
<p>This check examines whether a word is used that might be treated as a reserved word in an upcoming version. It is not possible to predict all future reserved words, but the check includes the words that are most likely to be used.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Text in single quotation marks</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the use of text in single quotes.</p>
<p>This check examines whether system-oriented text in the source is written in single quotes.</p>
<p>The system must be maintainable, so if a text or a numeric constant is used with the same meaning in more than one place, the text is defined as locally as possible: a member function, in a class declaration, or globally in a macro.</p>
<p>Always consider an alternative way to get the &quot;constant&quot;; often, it is defined in another place, from where it can be reused.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>XML documentation</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the XML documentation for errors.</p>
<p>This check verifies that the XML documentation comments are properly formatted and contain required information.</p>
<p>The following list describes the main rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tag pairs must match containing an opening and closing tag.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation is missing after certain tags are used.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Version control references</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether referenced elements are under version control.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>SysOperation label attribute</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check whether a label defined is a label ID and not a string. When using the SysOperationLabelAttribute or SysOperationGroupAttribute attributes, you can specify the label as part of its constructor.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>Form size</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check that the form size does not exceed the maximum size.</p>
<p>A form must fit into a screen with a resolution of 1024x768 pixels. If the screen resolution exceeds 1024x768 pixels a warning is issued. If the screen resolution exceeds 1280x1024 pixels an error is issued.</p>
<p>To calculate the form size, the check will open and close the form, and will therefore cause the screen to flicker.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Disabling technique</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Check the setup of form control disabling.</p>
<p>The following list describes how fields that the user should not be able to change should be set on the property sheet or from code.</p>
<p><strong>AllowEdit</strong>: Set to <strong>No</strong>, so that the user cannot change the value. The <strong>AllowEdit</strong> property is available on each field in a table, each field in a form data source, and each control on a form. If <strong>AllowEdit</strong> is set to <strong>No</strong>, set it as close to the table field as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Skip</strong>: Set to <strong>Yes</strong>. Set <strong>Skip</strong> to <strong>Yes</strong> if the user should not enter the field when he or she is tabbing through the form.</p>
