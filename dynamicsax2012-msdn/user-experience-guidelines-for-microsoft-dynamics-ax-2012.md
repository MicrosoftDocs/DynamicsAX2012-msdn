## Key concepts of the Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 user experience

With the release of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012, a new user experience, based on customer-research, has been designed to be powerful enough for user productivity and yet simple enough for new and existing users to quickly ramp up on using the software.
