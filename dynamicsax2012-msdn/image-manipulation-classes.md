# Image Manipulation Classes 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

There are two system classes that enable you to manipulate graphics and icons.

The [Image Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg910986\(v=ax.60\)) enables you to load, save, and manipulate individual images. For example, you can capture a screen and save it as an image, crop or rotate an image, or manipulate the color depth.

The [Imagelist Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg911024\(v=ax.60\)) enables you to work with a set of images that have some common properties, such as size and transparency color. The image lists that are used in the application can be viewed in the application classes called ImageListAppl\_\*.
