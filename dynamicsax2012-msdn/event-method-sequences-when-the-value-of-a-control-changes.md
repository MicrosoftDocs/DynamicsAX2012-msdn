# Event Method Sequences when the Value of a Control Changes [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Event methods are executed when the value of a control changes. The exact sequence of event methods varies for different controls.

## Check Box Scenario

The example scenario uses a simple form that has a check box control. The check box is bound to a field in a data source.

A check box is a control that has a value property. In contrast, a grid control contains fields that each display a value, but the grid itself does not have a value property.
