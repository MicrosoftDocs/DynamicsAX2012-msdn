# Handling Workflow Events 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Microsoft Dynamics AX workflow uses events to initiate business logic in your application. For example, the workflow type has a property event handler for business logic when a workflow is started. Workflow tasks and approvals have started and canceled property event handlers and also an event handler for each outcome type. This section describes workflow events and how to implement them in your application.
