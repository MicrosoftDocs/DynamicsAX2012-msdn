# Cross-reference Tool [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Microsoft Dynamics AX cross-reference system allows you to see the relationships between objects. You can see the following:

  - Which other objects use the current object

  - Which other objects the current object uses

For example, you can get a list of every piece of code that uses a particular method, or you can see which forms use a particular table field. You can also get information about where labels are used in the application.
