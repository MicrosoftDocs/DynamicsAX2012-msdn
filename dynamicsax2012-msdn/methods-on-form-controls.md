# Methods on Form Controls [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Each control on a form has a standard group of methods that you can override to customize the behavior of the control. The methods that you can override depend on the type of control. Use the following steps to access these methods.

1.  In the AOT, expand the node for the control.

2.  Right-click the **Methods** node.

3.  Click **Override Method**.

The methods available in the **Override Method** menu are a subset of those available on the system class for that control type. For example, methods for manipulating **CheckBox** controls are in the FormCheckBoxControl class. The methods for manipulating **Grid** controls are in the FormGridControl class. For a list of these classes, see [Form Control Classes](form-control-classes.md).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Code written on forms cannot be re-used or inherited. If possible, write your code on the underlying table or in a class.</P>



The following table lists methods that you can override. Some of the methods are used by several types of controls although others are unique to a single type of control. For more information about a method, see the related topic in the class reference section of Help. For example, the copy method for a **ComboBox** control is described in the FormComboBoxControl.copy method topic. The copy method for a **Tree** control is described in the FormTreeControl.copy method topic.
