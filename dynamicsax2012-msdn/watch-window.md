# Watch Window [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The **Watch** window in the Microsoft Dynamics AX debugger displays a user-defined range of variables. Choose the names of the variables that you want to appear in this window by entering the variable names or by dragging a variable from the **Variables** window or from the code window into the **Watch** window.

As you step through code in the debugger, when a variables changes, it is highlighted in a different color in the **Watch** window.

It is possible to modify the value of a variable in the **Watch** window. If a single line contains a compound object, you can click the plus sign (+) to expand it.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Microsoft Dynamics AX must be in break mode for you to modify variable values. Also, the maximum tooltip length for these values is 1,024 characters. Anything longer than this is truncated.</P>



To clear watch variables, use these menu options in the shortcut menu of the **Watch** window:

  - **Clear Current Watch**
    
    This deletes all the watch variables from the currently focused watch view.

  - **Clear All Watches**
    
    This removes all watch variables from all of the watch views, regardless of focus.
