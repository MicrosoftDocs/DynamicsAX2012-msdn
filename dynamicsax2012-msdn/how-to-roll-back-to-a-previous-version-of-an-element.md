# How to: Roll Back to a Previous Version of an Element 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you use version control in Microsoft Dynamics AX, you can revert to a previous version of the object.

### To roll back to a previous version of an object

1.  In the AOT, right-click an object and then click **Check Out**.

2.  Right-click the object in the AOT, and then click **History**.

3.  In the **History** form, select the version to which you want to roll back, and then click **Get**.

4.  Close the **History** form, right-click the object, and then click **Check In**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you rename an object, do not synchronize the object to a version of the object from before the object was renamed.</P>
