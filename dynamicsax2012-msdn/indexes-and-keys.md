# Indexes and Keys [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An index is a table-specific database structure that speeds the retrieval of rows from a table. Indexes are used to improve the performance of data retrieval and to ensure the existence of unique records. It's up to the database-specific query optimizer to use available indexes to facilitate efficient data retrieval.

Indexes are associated with a single table and located in the Application Object Tree (AOT) under the **Data Dictionary\\Tables** node underneath the specific table.
