# Best Practice Design Guidelines for Cost-Efficient Upgrades [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A Microsoft Dynamics AX application is typically upgraded several times during its lifetime. Upgrades may be made to the standard application, or to customized parts of the application. If the application is not designed according to some fundamental principles, upgrading can be expensive and very time-consuming.

This section of the SDK describes the relative cost of changing different types of application objects.
