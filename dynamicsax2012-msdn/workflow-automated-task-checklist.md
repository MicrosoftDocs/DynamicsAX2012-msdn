# Workflow Automated Task Checklist [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The following topic shows how you can create an automated task in a Microsoft Dynamics AX workflow. Before you create automated tasks, you must have a workflow type. For more information, see [Creating a Workflow Type](creating-a-workflow-type.md).

## Automated Task Checklist for a Workflow

1.  Create an automated task in the Application Object Tree (AOT). For more information, see [How to: Create a Workflow Automated Task](how-to-create-a-workflow-automated-task.md).

2.  Create automated task event handler classes for the **ExecutionEventHandler** and **CanceledEventHandler** property settings, and then bind the event handlers to the automated task. For more information, see [How to: Create a Workflow Event Handler](how-to-create-a-workflow-event-handler.md).

3.  Set the **Document** property for the automated task to match the workflow type **Document** property setting. For more information, see [How to: Create a Workflow Document Class](how-to-create-a-workflow-document-class.md).
