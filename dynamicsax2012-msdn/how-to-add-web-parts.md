# How to: Add Web Parts [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Web parts for pages in Enterprise Portal are added directly in SharePoint using the web-based interface. For information about the web part types that are used in Enterprise Portal, see [Web Part Types](web-part-types.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>To add web parts in Enterprise Portal, we recommend that you have at least Design permissions for the Enterprise Portal site.</P>



## Adding a New Web Part

### To add a new Web part

1.  In Enterprise Portal, browse to the page for which you want to add a new web part.

2.  In the ribbon, display the **Page** tab.

3.  Click the **Edit Page** command.

4.  In the section where you want to create the new Web part, click **Add a Web Part**.

5.  In the **Categories** list, select the category of web part that you want to add. The web parts that are specific to Enterprise Portal are found in the Microsoft Dynamics AX category.

6.  In the **Web Parts** list, select the web part type that you want to add to the page.

7.  Verify the **Add Web Part to:** setting to make sure that the web part is being added to the correct section of the page.

8.  Click **Add**. The web part will be added at the top of the section. If necessary, move the web part to the appropriate location in the section by dragging it where you want it.

9.  In the menu for the web part, click **Edit Web Part**. The properties and settings for the web part will be displayed.

10. Make changes to the settings. The settings for each Microsoft Dynamics AX web part type can be found in [Web Part Types](web-part-types.md), which contains a description of each web part type.

11. Click **Apply** to have the changes applied to the web part.

12. Click **OK** to save the changes and close the list of properties.

13. Save the changes to the page by clicking **Stop Editing** in the **Page** tab.

14. If you will be distributing the web part modifications to other Enterprise Portal installations, import the updated page into the AOT. For more information, see [How to: Import Pages into the AOT](how-to-import-pages-into-the-aot.md).
