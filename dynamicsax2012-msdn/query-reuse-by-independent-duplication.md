# Query Reuse by Independent Duplication 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Application Object Tree (AOT) can duplicate an existing query with just a few mouse clicks. This avoids the labor of manually creating the duplicate query the same way that the original query was created. In this sense, the duplication feature is a kind of query reuse.

## Duplicate a Query

The following steps describe how to duplicate a query.

1.  In the AOT, right-click the existing query that you want to duplicate.

2.  Click **Duplicate**, which creates a new query named **CopyOf** Queryname.

## The Duplicate is Independent

After the duplicate query is created, changes to the original query do not affect the duplicate.

Unlike a composite query, a duplicate query can be modified any way that you want. For more information, see [Query Reuse by Composite Queries](query-reuse-by-composite-queries.md).
