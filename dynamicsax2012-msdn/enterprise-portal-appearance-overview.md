# Enterprise Portal Appearance Overview [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can customize the appearance of Enterprise Portal. There are several ways you can do this:

  - You can apply a SharePoint theme to an Enterprise Portal site. This is the primary way to customize the appearance. SharePoint themes control the colors and fonts that are used for a site. You can use one of the predefined themes or you can create your own theme.

  - You can modify the cascading style sheets that control the appearance of Enterprise Portal elements.

  - You can add images to Microsoft Dynamics AX and use them on Enterprise Portal pages.
