# How to: Create a Field Group 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Field groups enable you to do the following:

  - Add a group of fields to a form or report in one step.

  - Add a label to a group of fields.

## Create a Field Group

1.  In the AOT, expand the **Data Dictionary** node, and then expand the **Tables** node.

2.  Locate the table that you want to add a field group to, and expand that node.

3.  Right-click **Field Groups**, and then click **New Group**.
    
    This will add a new field group called Group1.

4.  Right click the new field group, click **Properties**, and then type a name for the field group in the **Name** property.

5.  Right-click the table, click **Open New Window**, and then expand the **Fields** node.

6.  In the new window, drag fields from the **Fields** node onto your new field group.

7.  Save the updated version of your table.
