# How to: Create Pages [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Pages in Enterprise Portal are created directly in SharePoint using the web-based interface. After a page is created, content can be added to it. For more information about the various page types that are used in Enterprise Portal, see [Page Types](page-types.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> <P>To create pages in Enterprise Portal, we recommend that you have at least Design permissions for the Enterprise Portal site.</P>



## Creating a New Page

### To create a new page

1.  In Enterprise Portal, navigate to the module site where you want to create the page. The new page will be added to the corresponding workspace for Enterprise Portal. For example, if you want to create a page in the Sales site of Enterprise Portal, navigate to that module site.

2.  On the **Site Actions** menu, click **More Options**. A dialog that contains a list of the items that you can create is displayed.

3.  Make sure that the **All Categories** and **Page** filter options are selected.

4.  Click **Web Part Page**, and then click **Create**.

5.  Name the new page.

6.  If you are creating a web part page, select the layout template to use.

7.  Specify the document library into which the page will be added. Typically, pages for Enterprise Portal are added into the Enterprise Portal library.

8.  Click **Create** to create the new page.
