# Extending the Alerts Functionality [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The guidelines in this section provide information about how the Alerts functionality can be customized within the Alerts framework. The Alerts functionality is a notification system that helps users track critical events in Microsoft Dynamics AX, and the Alerts framework is the framework that enables the Alerts functionality.

Understanding the framework will enable you to customize it for your customers’ needs. You will also receive step-by-step guidance on how to customize events, actions, and the user interface (UI) for rules, as indicated in the table below.

The Alerts functionality consists of four major parts; with the exception of event detection, you are likely to modify all of them:

  - Rule creation

  - Event detection

  - Event processing

  - Alert viewing

The following two tables describe various aspects of Alerts (on a module-by-module basis) that are essential to customizing the Alerts functionality.

<td><p>Any type of change (in data) or activity being monitored. The current implementation of the Alerts functionality can monitor change-based events and due date events.</p>
<p>A change-based event is an event type that occurs when users create, delete, or change a record. Change-based events are categorized into create and delete events. These event types include creating and deleting records, and updating events that include changing records. Change-based events are also referred to as Create/Update/Delete (CUD) events.</p>
<p>A due date event is an event type that occurs when a date occurs that is specified in the system.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Rule</p></td>
<td><p>To monitor events, you must subscribe to them. A rule is basically your subscription to a certain type of event; for example, when a record is inserted in a specific table.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Alert</p></td>
<td><p>A notification that you receive when an event occurs to which you have subscribed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Action</p></td>
<td><p>The response of the system to a certain type of event. For example, an action could be inserting an alert in a user's inbox or sending an e-mail message. The current implementation of the Alerts functionality enables multiple actions per event to be carried out.</p></td>
