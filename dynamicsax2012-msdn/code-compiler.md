# Code Compiler [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To compile X++ code, open the code in the Code editor and press F7, or press the Compile icon.

If you are using the Version Control system for Microsoft Dynamics AX, the X++ compiler is also activated when you check an object in.

The compiler output window is described in the online Help. For the Help topic about the compiler output window, see [Compiler Output Form](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa499387\(v=ax.60\)). Or for information about the SysCompilerOutput class, you can use the Application Object Tree (AOT). Highlight the node **Classes** \> **SysCompilerOutput**, and then press F1. This starts a web browser that opens to a Help topic for the class.

You can change the appearance and content of the compiler output window by using the compiler setup form that is available by clicking the menu **Tools** \> **Options** \> **Development** \> **Compiler**. This starts the **Compiler setup** form. You can use the **Compiler setup** form to change the warning levels that are reported to the compiler output window, or to choose whether cross-reference is updated during each compile. For more information about the **Compiler setup** form, see [Compiler Setup Form](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa617600\(v=ax.60\)).
