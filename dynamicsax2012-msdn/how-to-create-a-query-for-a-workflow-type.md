# How to: Create a Query for a Workflow Type [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Before you create a workflow type, you must first create a query that will access the table fields for the workflow document. The following procedure describes how to create a query that will be used by the workflow type.

### To create a query for a workflow type

1.  In the AOT, right-click the **Queries** node, and then click **New Query**. A query group displays under the **Queries** node.

2.  Right-click the new query and then click **Rename**. Enter a name for the query.

3.  Expand the new query, right-click the **Data Sources** node, and then click **New Data Source**. A data source group displays under the **Data Sources** node.

4.  Right-click the new data source group and then click **Properties**.

5.  In the **Properties** sheet, set the **Table** property to the main table for the document type for which you are defining a workflow.

6.  In the AOT, right-click the new query and then click **Save**.
