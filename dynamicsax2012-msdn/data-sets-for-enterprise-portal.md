# Data Sets for Enterprise Portal [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Data sets in Microsoft Dynamics AX provide a generic data access layer that allows for external presentation layers to bind to Microsoft Dynamics AX tables and data types. Data sets have a managed programming model. Enterprise Portal uses data sets as the primary way to access data.

You will use existing data sets to access Microsoft Dynamics AX data from Enterprise Portal. You will create new data sets to access data from any tables that you created.

The [AxDataSource](axdatasource.md) component for User Controls provides the connection between the ASP.NET controls that are used for Enterprise Portal and the data sets defined in Microsoft Dynamics AX.
