# QuickLaunch Web Part [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The QuickLaunch web part is used to provide navigation on the left side of pages in Enterprise Portal. It displays the web menu content indicated by the QuickLaunch property of the web submodule in which the page is located.

For example, a page is located in the site for the Sales submodule. The QuickLaunch web part on that page will display content from the web menu specified by the value in the QuickLaunch property of the Sales submodule.

A QuickLaunch web part is shown in the following illustration.
