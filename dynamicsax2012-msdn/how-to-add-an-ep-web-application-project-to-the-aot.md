_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

An EP Web Application Project is one of the major components of an Enterprise Portal integration. After you create an EP Web Application project, you can add it to the AOT. This lets you package the Visual Studio project together with the other resources that you are creating for Enterprise Portal.

## Adding an EP Web Application Project to the AOT

### To add an EP Web Application Project to the AOT

1.  Start Visual Studio.

2.  Open the EP Web Application project you created.

3.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the EP Web Application project and then click **Add \<project name\> to AOT**.

After the EP Web Application Project has been added to the AOT, any changes you make to the project will be saved in the AOT.
