_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In Microsoft Dynamics AX, application objects are defined in the Application Object Tree (AOT) and are instantiated at runtime. The AOT also contains application resources, references, and documentation. This section describes the AOT and its contents, how to use the AOT to define application objects, and how to import and export definitions of application objects.

For reference information about the properties for element nodes in the AOT, see [Properties of AOT Elements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg731856\(v=ax.60\)).
