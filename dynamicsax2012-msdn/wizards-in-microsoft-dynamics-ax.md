# Wizards in Microsoft Dynamics AX [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A wizard is a special form of user assistance that takes the user through a task by using a series of dialog boxes. Wizards are especially useful for complex or infrequent tasks that the user may have difficulty learning or doing, or for tedious, frequently performed tasks.

Following are examples of standard Microsoft Dynamics AX wizards, available in **Tools**:

  - The **Report Wizard** simplifies report generation process by leading the user through the steps necessary for creating a report. The wizard provides identical functionality to the commands in the **Report** node's shortcut menu.

  - The **Class Wizard** guides you through all the required selections necessary to create a class, and allows you to inherit from an existing Microsoft Dynamics AX class.

To help you create your own wizards with the same look and feel as the standard wizards, Microsoft Dynamics AX includes a [Wizard Wizard](how-to-create-wizards.md).


> [!TIP]
> <P>Use the <STRONG>Application Hierarchy Tree</STRONG> facility to get a list of all the wizards in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Open the <STRONG>Application Object Tree</STRONG> and select the SysWizard class. Right-click to open the shortcut menu and then click <STRONG>Add-Ins</STRONG> &gt; <STRONG>Application Hierarchy Tree</STRONG>.</P>
