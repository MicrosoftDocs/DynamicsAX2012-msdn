# X++ Code Editor [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The X++ code editor is a text editor that supports color-coding, word completion, automatic indenting, scripting, zoom, multiline editing, and many other features that are available in Visual Studio.

To open the code editor, double-click a code element in the AOT. Alternatively, click **Edit** in the shortcut menu for an element, or create a new job from the **Jobs** node in the AOT.

The editor enables you to perform standard editing functions, such as copy, cut, and paste.

The editor has shortcut menus (activated by right-clicking) where the available commands depend on whether you have selected text in the editor.

Scripts are available to help you quickly complete common programming tasks. For more information, see [Editor Scripts](editor-scripts.md).
