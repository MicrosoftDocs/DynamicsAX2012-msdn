# How to: Check Elements Out of the Version Control System [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

If you use a version control system, you must check items out from the Application Object Tree (AOT) or from Visual Studio before you can edit them.

## Checking out an element

### To check out an element from the AOT

  - In the AOT, right-click the element, and then click **Check Out**.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>If you see an <STRONG>Add to Version Control</STRONG> option instead of a <STRONG>Check Out</STRONG> option, the element has not yet been added to the version control system. Click <STRONG>Add to Version Control</STRONG>, and then check in the item.</P>



The **Check Out** command synchronizes the local copy with the version control system copy before checking it out. You can select multiple items in the AOT and check them out in one step.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can only check out whole elements, not their individual members. For example, you cannot check out a method without checking out the class that contains it.</P>
