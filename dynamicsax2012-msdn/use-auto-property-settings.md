# Use Auto Property Settings [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A general design rule is to keep as many property settings set to **Auto** as possible. The benefit of doing this is that the application objects will automatically adjust to any changes of the kernel’s interpretation the application object’s behavior, such as how a form or report should be displayed.
