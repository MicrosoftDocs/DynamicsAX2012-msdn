# .NET Interop from X++ [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Classes in assemblies that are managed by the common language runtime (CLR) can be accessed in X++ code. This feature of Microsoft Dynamics AX is called .NET interop from X++.

.NET interop from X++ is useful when you want your X++ code to access the functionalities in a CLR managed assembly. This includes assemblies that are installed with the .NET Framework. It also includes any assemblies that you create with a language such as C\# or Visual Basic.

The .NET interop from X++ feature works in the direction from X++ calling into CLR managed assemblies. For information about .NET interop in the other direction, see the following topics:
