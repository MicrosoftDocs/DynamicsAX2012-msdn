# How to: Deploy Pages from the AOT [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A page definition in the AOT can be deployed to a specified Enterprise Portal web site.

## Deploying a Page from the AOT

The following procedure explains how to choose from a list of Enterprise Portal web sites, and then deploy a page definition from the AOT to that Enterprise Portal installation.

### To deploy a page from the AOT

1.  In the Navigation Pane, click **System administration**.

2.  In the **Setup** group, expand the **Enterprise Portal** node.

3.  Under **Enterprise Portal**, click **Web sites** to open the Administration of Web sites form.

4.  The **Default Enterprise Portal site** URL at the bottom of the window indicates the Enterprise Portal site that the AOT points to. Use the combo box next to this field to select the Enterprise Portal site that the AOT currently points to. This is the web site to which pages will be deployed.

5.  In the AOT, expand the **Web** node, expand the **Web Files** node, and then expand the **Page Definitions** node.

6.  Right-click the page definition, and then click **Deploy Element**. The page will be deployed to the default Enterprise Portal site that you specified.
