# About the Development Workspace [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

The Development Workspace in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 provides tools to create and edit application elements, such as forms, tables, and X++ classes.

By default, Microsoft Dynamics AX opens in the Application Workspace, which displays user interface elements for end-users. To open a Development workspace, press CTRL + Shift + W. You can also open Microsoft Dynamics AX directly into a development workspace. For more information, see [How to: Open a Development Workspace](how-to-open-a-development-workspace.md).

By using two or more display monitors, you can open multiple workspaces on the same client where application elements are always synchronized. Up to eight workspaces per client can be opened at the same time, and you can drag-and-drop application elements between different Development workspaces.

You can open forms and menu items from the AOT within the Development Workspace. To view forms in the context of the end-user interface, switch to the Application Workspace.

## Customizing the Development Workspace

By default, the AOT and the **Properties** sheet are automatically opened when a Development Workspace is opened. The **Properties** sheet and the Compiler output window can be docked or moved as needed by right-clicking the title bar for the window, and then selecting a new location. Window sizing and location preferences are saved automatically when you close the Development Workspace.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If a <STRONG>Startup project</STRONG> is specified on the <STRONG>Development</STRONG> tab of the <STRONG>Options</STRONG> form, the startup project opens instead of the AOT. However, if the startup project is already open in another Development Workspace, the AOT opens by default in a new Development Workspace.</P>
