# Application Explorer [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Application Explorer is a tool in Visual Studio that provides a view into the model store in Microsoft Dynamics AX. You can use Application Explorer to view model elements in the model store and perform tasks. Application Explorer is only available in Visual Studio after you have installed the Visual Studio Tools as part of your Microsoft Dynamics AX installation process. For more information, see [Install Visual Studio Tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd309576\(v=ax.60\)). For more information about Microsoft Dynamics AX development with Visual Studio, see the following:

  - [Visual Studio Integration](visual-studio-integration.md)

  - [Visual Studio Development for Microsoft Dynamics AX](visual-studio-development-for-microsoft-dynamics-ax.md)

To open Application Explorer, do the following:

1.  In Visual Studio, click **View** \> **Application Explorer**.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The Application Explorer window opens in the last saved position. To reposition the window, right-click the title bar and select a docking option.</P>



The following illustration shows the Application Explorer window in Visual Studio. The root node or top-level node shows you information about the model store. The format of the data in the root node is \<Configuration Name\> (Layer Name) \[Model Name\]\>. You can configure Application Explorer to reference a specific Microsoft Dynamics AX client configuration. For more information, see [How to: Open Visual Studio with a Specific Configuration](how-to-open-visual-studio-with-a-specific-configuration.md).
