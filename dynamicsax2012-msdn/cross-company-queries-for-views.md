# Cross-Company Queries for Views [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

In the Application Object Tree (AOT), you can build a view by dragging a query node onto the **Data Sources** node of your view. The query could have the **AllowCrossCompany** property set to **Yes**. However, this will not return cross-company results from the view.

To return cross-company results from a view, you need to use the crossCompany keyword on the select statement that reads from the view. The **AllowCrossCompany** setting on the view's data source query is ignored in X++ select statements that read from a view.
