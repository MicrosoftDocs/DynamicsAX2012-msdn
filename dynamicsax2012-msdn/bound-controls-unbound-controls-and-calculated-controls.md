# Bound Controls, Unbound Controls, and Calculated Controls [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Form controls belong to one of three groups, depending on their data source as follows:

  - Bound control – associated with a field in an underlying table. Use bound controls to display, enter, and update values from fields in the database.

  - Unbound control – does not have a data source. Use unbound controls to display pictures and static text.

  - Calculated controls – uses a method as the data source. An example of a calculated control is the sum of two fields on a form.

To create bound controls, drag a group or an individual field from a data source for the form to the form **Design** node. Some of the properties are inherited from the database field (and some of the field properties are inherited from the data type used for the field).

For information about how to add a bound, unbound, or calculated control to a form, see [How to: Add a Control to a Form](how-to-add-a-control-to-a-form.md).
