# Tables as Classes [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Application tables can be viewed as being similar to application classes in Microsoft Dynamics AX, but with the following differences from classes:

  - Tables are persistent.

  - Table fields are always public.

  - A table in the AOT almost always corresponds to a real object.

  - The definition of a table must sometimes be erased if you later want another table to extend it.
