description: Learn how to change the design pattern of a company using the changeCompany function in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. Ideal for large companies splitting into entities.

# Change Company Design Pattern 


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

A change to the design pattern of a large company is often the result of it being split into several legal entities. The Microsoft Dynamics AX development environment supports this by using the changeCompany function in X++.

The changeCompany statement is used to alter the database settings to another (separate) company. The syntax of the statement is:

changeCompany ( Expression ) Statement

Expression is a string that defines which company is to be used. The statement is executed on the new company. The following example shows how to use this statement.

    static void main()
    {
        CustTable custTable;
        ;
     
        // Assume that you are running in company 'aaa'.
        changeCompany('bbb') // Default company is now 'bbb'.
        {
            custTable = null;
            while select custTable
            {
                // custTable is now selected in company 'bbb'.
            }
        }
        // Default company is again set back to 'aaa'.
     
        changeCompany('ccc') // Default company is now 'ccc'.
        {
        
            // Clear custTable to let the select work
            // on the new default company.
            custTable = null;
        
     
            while select custTable
            {
                // custTable is now selected in company 'ccc'.
            }
        }
        // Default company is again 'aaa'.
    }

## changeCompany Interactions with crossCompany

The changeCompany keyword is useful in scenarios where the crossCompany keyword is used. For more information, see [Cross-Company Data Modification Using X++](cross-company-data-modification-using-x.md).
