# How to: Add a Task, Automated Task, or Approval to a Workflow Type [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

To make them available for use, you must add the tasks, automated tasks, and approvals that you create in the Microsoft Dynamics AX Application Object Tree (AOT) **Workflow** node to the workflow type. The following procedure describes how to add a task, automated task, or an approval to a workflow type.

### To add a task, automated task, or approval to a workflow type

1.  In the AOT, expand the **Workflow** node.

2.  Expand the **Workflow Types** node, and then expand the workflow type that you want to add a task or approval to.

3.  Expand the **Tasks** node, the **Automated Tasks** node, or the **Approvals** node. Drag the top-level node of the task, automated task, or the approval onto the **Supported Elements** node of the target workflow type.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>The <STRONG>Document</STRONG> property setting of the task, automated task, or approval must be same as the <STRONG>Document</STRONG> property setting for the workflow type.</P>
