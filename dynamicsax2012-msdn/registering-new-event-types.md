# Registering New Event Types [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

When your custom event type class is implemented, you must register it with the Alerts framework. The Alerts framework enables the Alerts functionality, which is a notification system that helps users track critical events in Microsoft Dynamics AX. To register your custom event type class, you need to list it in the EventType::eventTypeClassIdsHook static method of EventType class. The method is formatted as follows.

    protected static container eventTypeClassIdsHook()
    {
        return [classNum(myEventTypeClass1), classNum(myEventTypeClass2), ... ];
    }

## Register a New Event Type

If you implement only the EventTypeCUDIncreasedAtLeastBy event type class, the method is formatted as follows.

    protected static container eventTypeClassIdsHook()
    {
        return [classNum(EventTypeCUDIncreasedAtLeastBy)]; 
    }

When you have done this, your custom event type will appear in the list of events offered for numerical fields in the **EventCreateRule** form. The following figure shows the **EventCreateRule** form with the option **has increased above:** appearing for selection in the **Event** field.

The option **has increased above:**, which now appears in the list, is the label returned by the Description method of your custom event type class.

After you select the **has increased above:** event, enter the appropriate value in the text box next to the **Event** field. The following figure shows the **EventCreateRule** form with a value that qualifies the **has increased above:** option.

For many forms, when you right-click on the form, you see the option to **Create alert rule...**. Clicking the option starts the **Create alert rule** form.
