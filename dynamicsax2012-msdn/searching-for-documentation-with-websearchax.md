**The WebSearchAx.htm page**   

The labels on the **WebSearchAx** page are displayed in the language of the user. However, all Help topics found by **WebSearchAx** are in English.

## Application User Help is Installed Locally

The Help server is part of a complete install of Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012. The Help server hosts Help topics for the application user audience. Each Help topic is an .htm file that can be viewed with the Help viewer or any web browser. The Help server hosts the following types of topics:

  - Help topics that are installed with the product.  
    The hosted topics target application users and the Application Workspace.

  - Help topics for forms that are used by developers and system administrators.  
    These Help topics are not listed in the table of contents in the Help viewer. You can see this type of Help topic by pressing the F1 key while the form has focus.

  - Custom help topics that are created by partners and customers.  
    For more information, see [Writing Documentation for the Help System](writing-documentation-for-the-help-system.md).

The Help viewer is the client that you use to read topics from the Help server. You start the Help viewer when you press F1 from the Application Workspace. In addition, you can use links that are available in the Help menu of the Application Workspace. The Help viewer includes links to **WebSearchAx** at the bottom of every search results list.

For more information about the Help server and Help viewer, see [Help System Components](help-system-components.md).
