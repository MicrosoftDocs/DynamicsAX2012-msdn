# Forms in Microsoft Dynamics AX [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

This section of the documentation describes how to design, build, and customize a Microsoft Dynamics AX form. A typical form displays a collection of related data and often includes descriptive text, and graphic elements like lines and images. To create or modify a form, you use the Application Object Tree (AOT). You can also use X++ to dynamically create and display a form. You can design forms to do the following:

  - Enter or modify data in the database

  - Open other forms or reports

  - Activate commands, such as Create Record or Delete Record

  - Accept and act on user input
