# Web Part Communication [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Web part communication makes it possible for web parts on a page to respond to information published by other web parts on the page. For example, when a user selects an item in a list, that web part can publish what item was selected. Other web parts on the page can automatically update to display data that corresponds to the selected item. This occurs only when communication is set up between the web parts.
