# How to: Use the \#undef Directive [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

You can use the \#undef directive to remove a macro definition that exists from a previous \#define. After a macro name has been created by \#define and then removed by \#undef, the macro can be created again by another \#define.

\#undef has no effect on macros that are created by the \#localmacro directive.

## Prerequisites

For this topic, you must understand the information in [How to: Use \#define and \#if to Test a Macro](how-to-use-sharpdefine-and-sharpif-to-test-a-macro.md).

## Using \#undef

In the following code sample, the macro MyMacro is undefined by using the \#undef directive. The \#undef occurs between the two \#if tests for its existence. The output shows only the first \#if test was true.

    static void UndefMacroJob(Args _args)
    {
        ;
        #define.MyMacro
    
        #if.MyMacro
            info("Macro is defined (1)");
        #endif
    
        #undef.MyMacro // Removes the macro.
    
        #if.MyMacro
            info("Macro is defined (2)");
        #endif
    
    /************* Actual output
    Message (10:19:15 am)
    Macro is defined (1)
    *************/
    }
