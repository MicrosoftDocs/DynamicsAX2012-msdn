It is good practice to write comments within your programs. This makes a program easier to read and understand. Comments are ignored when the program is compiled.

You can use "//" and "/\* … \*/" style comments, although it is best practice to use "//"-style comments, even for multiline comments. For more information, see [X++ Standards: Comments](x-standards-comments.md).
