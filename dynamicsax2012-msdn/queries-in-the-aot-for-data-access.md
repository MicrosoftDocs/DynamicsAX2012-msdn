# Queries in the AOT for Data Access [AX 2012]


_**Applies To:** Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 Feature Pack, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012_

Queries enable you to ask questions about the data in the Microsoft Dynamics AX database and retrieve information. There are two ways to create queries:

  - Use the **Queries** node in the Application Object Tree (AOT) to create static queries using a graphical interface. For more information about creating queries in the AOT, see [How to: Create Queries by using the AOT](how-to-create-queries-by-using-the-aot.md).

  - Use the query system classes to create dynamic queries in code. For more information about creating queries in code, see [How to: Create Queries by Using X++](how-to-create-queries-by-using-x.md).
